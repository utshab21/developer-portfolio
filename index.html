        <P>Learning itself is so important. Learning has no time or age restriction, all that we need is a passion for lifelong learning.
    
            Learning is something that takes place daily by interacting with other people and the world around us.

All these obstacles should not hinder our development of a lifelong learning process. It enhances our perspective towards the world to get better opportunities, thus improving our quality of life.</P>
