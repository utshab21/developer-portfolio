        <P>Learning itself is so important. Learning has no time or age restriction, all that we need is a passion for lifelong learning.
    
            Learning is something that takes place daily by interacting with other people and the world around us. Life often throws challenges at us, there may be hurdles to overcome, sometimes we compare ourselves with others who perform better than us, but one should never get demotivated. All these obstacles should not hinder our development of a lifelong learning process. It enhances our perspective towards the world to get better opportunities, thus improving our quality of life.</P>
